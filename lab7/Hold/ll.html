<h3> The Exercises </h3>

<p> For these exercises, <span class='cmd'>sNode</span> will be defined: </p>

<div class='file'>
<pre>typedef struct sNode sNode ;

struct sNode
{
   int i ;
   sNode *next ;
} ;</pre>
</div>

<h4> Arrays </h4>

<p> Remember that <span class='code'>a[i]</span> is equivalent to <span class='code'>*(a+i)</span> . </p>

<script><!--
	q = "Recall <span class='code'>add3</span> from last week.  Rewrite the function, "
	q	+= "call it <span class='code'>add3i(int *a, int n)</span> , but don't use <span class='code'>[]</span> .  "
	q += "Only pointer addition and dereference." 
	question( q )
	//--></script>

<h4> Linked lists </h4>

<p> For all of these, draw pictures, see what's happening.  Start by solving a general case, test it.  Then consider any
border cases which you may need to handle, tackle them imcrementally. </p>

<script><!--
	question( "Write a function <span class='code'>length( sNode *p )</span>  that takes a linked list, " +
						"returns the number of elements in it." )
	//--></script>

<script><!--
	question( "Write a function <span class='code'>sum( sNode *p )</span>  that takes a linked list, " +
						"returns the sum of the data fields." )
	//--></script>

<script><!--
	question( "Write a function <span class='code'>addk( sNode *p, int k )</span>  that takes a linked list, " +
						"adds <var>k</var> to each data field." )
	//--></script>

<script><!--
	q = "Write a function, <span class='code'>purge( sNode *p, int targ )</span> "
	q += "that removes <u>all</u> nodes containing <var>targ</var> from the list "
	q += "pointed to by <var>p</var>."
	question( q )
	//--></script>

<p> This one is a little tricky.  You have some border conditions to test for: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> The first node is to be removed </li>
		<li> The last node is to be removed </li>
		<li> An node to be removed is followed by a node to be removed </li>
	</ul>

<p> Again, write this in stages.  For example, maybe handle these cases in turn: </p>

	<ol>
		<li> Just a single node to be removed, buried in the middle </li>
		<li> Just a single node to be removed, at the front </li>
		<li> Just a single node to be removed, at the end </li>
		<li> Just a single node to be removed, the only one </li>
		<li> More than one target, not adjacent </li>
		<li> Several targets, some adjacent </li>
	</ol>

<!--
<h4> A Stack Implementation </h4>

	<p> In <span class='fn'>Labs/C/Stack-ll</span> see files: </p>
		<ol>
			<li> <span class='fn'>stack.h</span> &mdash; Interface for a stack of integers </li>
			<li> <span class='fn'>stack.c</span> &mdash; Implementation for the stack functions, partially implemented </li>
			<li> <span class='fn'>main.c</span> &mdash; Test driver for your stack </li>
			<li> <span class='fn'>makefile</span> </li>
		</ol>

	<p> The <span class='fn'>stack.h</span> file is written to be generic.  That is, if a client only codes to the
		provided interface, we can swap the implementation for an array-based stack, e.g., and the client code shouldn't be
		affected, shouldn't need to be modified. </p>

	<p> The stack has been partially implemented, by way of example, and definition.  There are three functions for you to
		finish (find the <span class='code'>TODO</spans>s).  Get this working, and submit the implementation file. </p>
