<h1> Lab &ndash; Finding Anagrams </h1>

<p> The directory for this lab is <span class='fn'>tux:/home/kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Labs/Anagram</span> . </p>

<p> In this lab we'll be exploring the UNIX philosophy of combining simple programs using pipes to solve an
interesting problem. </p>

<p> You will use some common *nix utilities, and a few small custom-written pieces (one of which you need to write).
You will provide a single script to pull all of this together. </p>

<h2> Problem Statement </h2>

<p> Write a Bash script called <span class='fn'>anagram</span> which finds the 8 largest anagram classes in the system
dictionary, <span class='fn'>/usr/share/dict/words</span>. </p>

<p> Two words are anagrams if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the letters.  For example, the words stop
and pots are anagrams since the letters "s", "t", "o", and "p" in "stop" can be rearranged to obtain the word "pots".
</p>

<p> For example, if the input looked like this: </p>

<div class='file'>
<pre>hat
at
flat
snap
yap
pay
what
meat
cat
paper
team
lager
rat
tar
large
tame</pre>
</div>

<p> , and if we'd asked for the top 4 classes, the output would look something like this: </p>

<div class='output'>
<pre>3 meat tame team
2 yap pay
2 rat tar
2 lager large</pre>
</div>


<h2> Strategies </h2>

<h3> Naive Attempt </h3>

<p> A naive way to test if two words are anagrams is to produce all permutations of the letters of one of the words and
compare each possible permuted sequence of letters to the other word.  If any sequence is equal to the other word then
they are anagrams.  For example, to determine if "ant" and "tan" are anagrams, we first generate the six possible
permutations of the letters in ant: </p>

<div class='file'>
<pre>ant
atn
nat
nta
tan
tna</pre>
</div>

<p> and compare each to tan.  Since the 5th permuted sequence is equal to tan, ant and tan are anagrams. </p>

<p> The problem with this approach is that as the number of letters increases, the number of permuted sequences gets
big.  For example, there are 3,628,800 permutations of a 10 letter word, and we'd need to do that for each pair of
words (n!). </p>

<h3> Finding a Cardinal Representation of Each Word </h3>

<p> A better approach to test if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters in each word and then compare these
canonical representations.  If the words are anagrams then they must have the same letters, and if they have the same
letters then they are anagrams.  For example, if we sort the letters in "stop" and "pots" we obtain the letter sequence
"opts" for both words, which shows that they are anagrams. </p>

<ol>
	<li> For each word in the file sort the letters to produce a key. </li>
	<li> Sort all of the words in the input file by their key. </li>
	<li> In the sorted list find all adjacent words with the same key (these are the anagram classes). </li>
</ol>

<h2> Tools </h2>

<p> The following programs are available for you to use (except one, which you'll have to write yourself). You may also
use any other Unix utilities. Your task is to combine these tools in a single Bash script using pipes and/or
redirects. </p>

<p> While developing, do one piece at a time, use redirection to build a piece, then use a pipe to hook it in to the
previous piece, and test. </p>

<p> Your final solution should not write any temporary files. </p>

<ol>
	<li> A C program called <span class='fn'>sign.c</span>. It reads a file of words (one per line) from stdin. For every
		word, it'll print to <span class='fn'>stdout</span> the word sorted by letters, followed by a space, followed by
		the original word.

		<p> For example, if the file <span class='fn'>temp</span> looked like this: </p>

		<div class='file'>
<pre>cat
pat
attack
tap</pre>
		</div>

		<p> then  </p>
		
		<div class='cli'>$ ./sign &lt; temp</div> 
		
		<p> should output: </p>

		<div class='output'>
<pre>act cat
apt pat
aacktt attack
apt tap</pre>
		</div>

		<p> You'll need to compile <span class='fn'>sign.c</span> into an executable to run it. You can do this by running
		the C compiler <span class='cmd'>gcc</span>. By default, <span class='cmd'>gcc</span> creates an executable named
		<span class='cmd'>a.out</span>. If you want to provide a different output filename, you can use the <span
		class='cmd'>-o</span> flag (see the gcc manpage for more details). </p> 
	</li>

	<li> The <span class='cmd'>sort</span> utility, which sorts its input. Remember that you can also sort numerically by
	using the <span class='cmd'>-n</span> flag.</p>
	</li>

	<li> An awk program called <span class='cmd'>squash.awk</span>, which will put all <strong>adjacent</strong> lines
	with the same first field onto the same line, space separated. For example, given the file <span
	class='fn'>temp</span> with these contents: 

		<div class='file'>
<pre>aacktt attack
act cat
apt pat
apt tap</pre>
		</div>

		<p> Running </p>
		
		<div class='cli'>$ awk -f squash.awk &lt; temp</div>
		
		<p> will output: </p>

		<div class='output'>
<pre>attack
cat
pat tap</pre>
		</div>
	</li>

	<li> You will write an <span class='cmd'>awk</span> program that counts the number of space-separated words on a
		line. For example, given this input:

		<div class='file'>
<pre>rat
tap pat
glare lager large regal
leap pale peal
meat tame team</pre>
		</div>

		<p> your awk program should output: </p>

		<div class='output'>
<pre>1 rat
2 tap pat
4 glare lager large regal
3 leap pale peal
3 meat tame team</pre>
		<div>
	</li>

	<li> The <span class='cmd'>head</span>/<span class='cmd'>tail</span> utilities, which print the first/last <span
	class='cmd'>n</span> lines of their input.</p>


<h2> Submission </h2>

<p> Your submission must include a Bash script named <span class='fn'>anagram</span>.  This is the top-level script
that orchestrates your solution.  It's the script we will call to see the magic happen. </p>

<p> We will invoke your script directly, so get the sha-bang right. </p>

<p> Your script must include a command to compile <span class='fn'>sign.c</span>. It will not be compiled for you. </p>

<p> Your top-level script will put this all together; it'll check for the needed files, compile the C program (and
anything else you need to have done), and put it all together, to print (to the screen) the required anagram classes.
</p>

<p> We will provide <span class='fn'>sign.c</span> and <span class='fn'>squash.awk</span> .  If you submit them, they
will be overwritten. </p>

<ul>
	<li> <span class='fn'>anagram</span> - Your top-level Bash script, the one we run to get the output. </li>
	<li> Any other files required, directly or indirectly, by your script (except for the dictionary itself). </li>
	<li> <span class='fn'>README</span> <i>(optional)</i> - anything you want to tell us before we grade. </li>
</ul>
