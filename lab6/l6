Q1.1--> The values are:
a. False
b. True
c. True
d. True
e. True
f. True
g. True
h. True
i. True

Q2.1 --> The code initializes i to 5 and j to i-1 which in this case is 4 (i=5,j=4). As the loop continues it checks
that the values of i and j are greater than j and then ends when the value of either i or j is equal to 0. As it goes
through the loop, the value of i is printed out. The output would be something like: 
		`5 4 3 2` because the value of j is equal to zero after the decrement done when the value of i = 2 and j = 1

Q2.2 --> The output should be 10,5,3,2,1..1,1 and the ones continue to be added more or less continuously

Q2.3 --> Edited code: 
`char resp = 'y' ;

while( resp=='y' || resp=='Y' )
{
   // processing...

   printf( "\nEnter another input? (y/[n]) => " ) ;
      // the space preceding the %c tells scanf to skip whitespace
   scanf( " %c", &resp ) ;
	if ( resp == 'n' || resp == 'N'){
	break;
	}else {
		resp = 'y';
	}
}`
