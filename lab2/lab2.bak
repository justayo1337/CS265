Q1 --> The output are the relative paths to the 'list', 'lab2'text files  and 'gotMe.bash' files in my course directory.
         -->./lab2/Tmp/gotMe.bash
            ./lab2/list
            ./lab2/lab2
Q2 --> The command is 'find . -type f -name "*.bash" 2>/dev/null' in order to find all files in the current directory
that end in .bash. To find across the whole system one would use 'find / -type f -name "*.bash" 2>/dev/null'.

Q3 --> The output is '499 breadIsDangerous.txt'  which is the word count of the file.

Q4 --> The output is similar to that from the previous question but it does not output the name of the file again. All
that is reported is he number '499'.

Q5 --> Running the command 'ls -1 | wc -l' returns the number of lines that result from the 'ls -1' command that lists the
files/folders in a directory line by line due to the '-1' flag. 

Q6 --> grep "bread"  breadIsDangerous.txt 

Q7 -->  grep "the"  breadIsDangerous.txt | wc -l or grep -i "the"  breadIsDangerous.txt | wc -l 

Q8 --> In addition to the edited spellExample file, there is also a spellExample.bak file that has been created as a backup
file if there is a need to rollback to the original version of the file.

Q9 --> The output shows the various lines that need to be changed or added to the .bak file. It shows the following: 
						
				1c1
< I went to a gadren party
---
> I went to a garden party
3c3
< bnuch of my old freinds did somehting
---
> bunch of my old friends did something
5a6
  						> An extra line
  --> where 1c1 means theres a difference between line one in the first file and line 1 in the second file. 5a6 more or
  less means to remove the difference a line needs to be added after the 5th line in file one for it to be like the
  second file.


Q10 --> There was no output this time since the same file was tested with itself.

Q11 --> I expected the numbers in the file to be sorted either in ascending or descending order, but that did not seem
to be the case.

Q12 --> The numbers in the file were sorted in ascending order this time because the '-n'flag was set which is described
as '-n, --numeric-sort compare according to string numerical value', hence making the utility sort the numeric contents
of the file in the order.

Q13  --> The files are sorted in order of their sizes from the largest file to the smallest file. The files are sorted
in descending order by filesizes.

Q14 --> A command that would work is 'du . -ah | sort -k1 -h -r | head -n 8' where the '.' can be replaced with any
directory that one is interested in.

Q15 --> The return values for grep are explained as follows: 'Normally  the  exit  status is 0 if a line is selected, 1
if no lines were selected, and 2 if an error occurred' according to the man page for the utility. The first command
	returned zero because a line was matched for 'dough' , the second returned 1 because there was no line
	matched/selected for 'uniqueString'; and the last command return 2 because there was not file called 'noSuchFile',
	thereby leading to an error message being printed by the command.


Q16 --> This command outputs 'File breadIsDangerous.txt has 499 words'

Q17 --> echo "The current directory is: $PWD" or echo "The current directory is: $(pwd)"
